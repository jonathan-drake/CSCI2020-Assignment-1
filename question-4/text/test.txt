Inception

What is inception?
	Phase occurs before the projects starts and to determine if its worth it

What is the goal of the inception phase?
	To measure if the project should be taking by the development team

Requirements
	Activity Diagrams
		What do activity diagrams represent?
			Used to represent the flow of actions/data, used in both analysis and design
		When activity diagrams should be used?
			Its to show the comparison for analysis, the step the user goes through or to validate the function that you are creating

Use Cases
	What are use cases?
		Text of the scenarios that the system can function
	The 3 use case types?
		fully dressed(A large amount of details, possible errors etc. i.2. lab03), Casual(more structed of brief, itemized steps), Brief (1,2 paragraphs)

What are actors?
	A role played by a user or any other system that interacts with the subject.

Types of actors?
	Primary(Customer, in contact with the system), Offstage(Services), Secondary(Those who benefit but no necessarily in contact)
	
What is the difference between a use case and a use case model?
	Use case is a text which tells the story of the system for user interaction, The use case diagram is the diagram representing this
	Use case model is the combination of both the Text and Diagram	




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Are use cases functional or non-functional requirements?
	Functional, they could have nonfunction but most commonly Functional

What is the difference between a use case and use case diagram?
	Use case is text based, while the use case diagram is a diagram based off the text base

What use case model consists of?
	Use case model consists of both text and Diagram

What is the notation suggestion for system actors in use case diagrams?
	The suggestions is to use the stick people as actors instead of the box.

What are three kinds of actors?


What are three common types of use case formats

Fully dressed, brief and Casual


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



What is the difference between waterfall methodology and iterative process?
	Waterfall is following the process linearly, iterative several small cycles that go through all steps

Which one and why would you recommend to use in the complex project?
	Iterative. Allows backtracking

What is unified process?
	A part of the iterative process, an iterative methodolgoy	

What is an example of Extreme Programming and Scrum, respectively?
	Extreme prgoramming is Pair programming, Scrum war rooms

What are the main UP disciplines? Does the emphasis on disciplines change over time?
	UP focuses on business modeling requirements and changes based on as its needed, programming starts early and the chance to implement
	and rethink modeling and business requirements

Is UP customizable? What are the constant characteristics of UP?
	Yes, It has iterative properties, manages risk of the project failing, you have a continous verification of quality


	


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



How to identify conceptual classes?
	Base off use cases and identify the nouns i.e Real world objects
	
What is the difference between domain model and design model?
	Domain model has conceptual classes(Real world) while design represents the software represenation of the solution

Does domain model represent software classes?
	It could, some of the domain objects could also be part of the design, but not necessarily when modeling the domain dont fret about design

Is domain model required in agile UP?
	No everything is customizable !!!!

Provide an example of conceptual classes connected by multiple associations.
	A flight going to an airport, connect by the flight paths	


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Provide an example of composite aggregation and shared aggregation.
	Compositite something is composed by other parts(Hand is composed by fingers), 
	Shared you have elemnts that are shared between different elements (UML Package and UMLElement)

What are the advantages of generalization from programming point of view?
	You can use methods of the parent class, the key idea is that You can re-use code

What is reflexive association? Provide an example of it.
	Reflexive association is when an object is self connected, I.e. a lecturer attends the lecture they lecture.

What is 100% rule and Is-a Test?
	A credit payment is a payment, it is a way to determine if you should create a class

What are two ways to model roles? Provide an example.
	!!!!!!!!!!! GUARENTEED ON MIDTERM: Roles by assosciated and roles by concept !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Week 7-1 slide 29 for example

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the two types of Interaction Diagrams?
	Sequence Diagram and Collaboration Diagram
	
Why Interaction Diagrams are useful?
	They provide a start for implementation design and show interaction between the classes

What is the advantage of Sequential Diagrams over Collaboration Diagrams?
	They show the timeline of when new objects are created, they show the timestamps and make it easier to understand the order of
	things happening by the way it is displayed

How to order messages in Collaboration Diagrams and Sequential Diagrams, respectively?
	hierachly order messages for collaboration, Indicate from top to bottom and follow the arrow for sequential

How to iterate over an multiobject in SDs (sequence diagram)?
	They are like two overlapping rectangles Indicating an iteration.
	

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Are interactions diagrams useful to create DCDs? If yes, how?
	yes, they can be a very good start for creating a design class diagram

What is navigability used for? 
	It is going to show the one object depends on the other. The object that is navigating to the other contains an instance of the object

How to determine the visibility of attributes and functions in DCDs?
	Symbols like + - # /

How to determine the order of the implementation of classes?
	The amount of dependencies (connections) that a class has

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why are State diagrams useful?
	It is used to indicate State, to understand what pages use which pages
	In terms of the course they are useful to show how objects react to messages through their flow
	It shows how the object changes the state because of the message

What are transitition action, guard condition and nest state used for in state diagrams provide examples
	Transition is the change, the transition is the dial tone, guard condition is the valid subscriber condition
	Nested state ****  Week 7-1 Slide 38 for example

What is partitioning used for in activity diagrams?
	Partitioning is the seperation of the actions of activites between the actors, making it easier to read
	i.e. the giant bars seperating the actors in the diagram

What is the meaning of Rake symbol and signals in Activity Diagrams?
	The rake symbol is used to indicate the activities that can be expanded, signals represent events.
